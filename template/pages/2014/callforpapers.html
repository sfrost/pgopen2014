                                <p>The first step to submit your proposal is to set up your speaker profile on <a href="/events/speakerprofile/pgopen2014/">this form</a>.
                                   This system uses the PostgreSQL Community Auth system (the same system used by the PostgreSQL wiki, CommitFest, and pgconf.eu).  Log in
                                   to the system with your PostgreSQL Community Auth credentials.  Please note that while this is the same code, the speaker profiles are
                                   not currently shared between pgconf.eu and postgresopen.org.</p>

                                <p>Once you've created your profile, this page will provide a link to a form where you can submit your
                                   talks for PostgresOpen 2014. When the site prompts for a login, use your
                                   regular postgresql.org community account.
                                </p>

                                <p>The submission deadline for tutorials and regular sessions is May 30, 2014.</p>

                                <p>The conference commitee will review proposals and notify selected speakers by June 9, 2014.</p>

                                <p>We will have a lightning talks session again this year! A separate CfP will be made for lightning talks closer to the conference dates.</p>

                                <p>All selected speakers will get free entry to the conference (excluding
                                   training sessions and tutorials). We do not in general cover travel and accommodations
                                   for speakers, but may be able to do that in limited cases. If you require
                                   assistance with funding to be able to attend, please make a note of this
                                   in the Submission Notes field.
