                                <p>While we do our best, even as a non-profit, we need certain policies to ensure that the event can make budget and be enjoyed by all.</p>

                                                <p>This policy is based in large part on this <a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment">example policy.</a>
                                                <p>PostgresOpen is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone.  We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form.  Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks.</p>
                                                <p>Conference participants violating this policy may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organizers.  It is the sole discretion of the conference committee if any action is considered to have violated this policy.</p>
                                                <p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing, photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.  Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.  Failure to comply will result in sanctions and/or ejection from the conference without a refund.</p>
                                                <p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including but not limited to: warning the offender, expulsion from the conference with no refund, and/or referral to appropriate authorities.  If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the conference staff, including anyone on the conference committee, immediately.</p>
                                                <p>Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference.  We value your attendance.  Decisions regarding appropriate assistance will be at the sole discretion of the conference committee.</p>
